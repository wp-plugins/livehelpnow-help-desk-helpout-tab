**Live Chat System** - rated #1 live chat support software by TopTenREVIEWS.

Open the door for your business to connect directly with its customers with the LiveHelpNow [Live Chat System](http://www.livehelpnow.net/help-desk-software/). Our chat software allows you to interact directly with website visitors in the same way you would in a traditional retail store. You wouldn’t ignore customers in your store, so don’t ignore the one visiting your site every day! Can't be at your computer? Chat on the go with Mobile Chat!

**Ticket System** – manage customer inquiries from start to finish; avoid the chaos and pitfalls of email.

LiveHelpNow [Ticket System](http://www.livehelpnow.net/products/ticket_system/) is an advanced inquiry management system that provides your website with its own helpdesk solution. Instead of sending you a string of emails your customers can submit their inquiries directly into the Ticket system using a customizable web form & then get instant confirmation that their request has been received. Automated status notifications keep customers in the loop and analytical reports gauge the effectiveness of your support team. The Ticket system allows your store to be open even when you're not there, giving you the ability to provide customer service 24/7/365.

**Callback Request System** - a missed phone call can very easily be a lost sale!

You wouldn't leave your business telephone without an answering machine; now there's no reason to leave visitors to your website without a way to leave a message for you. Our 24/7 Callback Request system allows your customers to notify you when they need to speak with a live operator. Collect the person's contact information and the time at which they'd like you to call them on a customizable web form and assign callbacks to your staff; requests are then queued and for easy and straightforward management.

**Knowledge Base System** – reduce customer support costs and improve customer satisfaction

Add a fully functional support center to your website using the LiveHelpNow [Knowledge Base System](http://www.livehelpnow.net/products/support_system/). Publish all the FAQs customers ask to one easily accessible location, and create private articles for your support team to utilize as they handle customer inquiries by phone, chat, ticket or email. Give new customers all the information they need to make a confident purchase and provide returning customers with quick resolutions to their burning questions. The Knowledge Base system can be fully customized to match your website design and it’s easy to manage with no technical skills required!
